## Getting started

Download from within your IDE or from the Jetbrains Marketplace. Once you have done that, it "just works".
After using the template to create your blank project, the [Template Cleanup][file:template_cleanup.yml] workflow will be triggered to override or remove any template-specific configurations, such as the plugin name, current changelog, etc.
